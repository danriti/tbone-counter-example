I'm Dan, the latest addition to the Tracelytics team! 

Managing complexity in front end web applications can be a burden, especially
when your application interfaces with many data sources.

TBone removes the complexity of manually managing data dependencies in Backbone,
enabling “live” templates as well as functions that automatically re-execute 
when the data they reference changes.

- The Problem: Managing complexity in front end web applications (Javascript)
- Event handling binds data to views
- As number of data sources increases, so does need to manage all the event
  handling between data and views.
- The solution: Tbone, automagic event handling for Backbone.
- Tbone was developed at Tracelytics to help solve this problem, and reduce the
  complexity of managing event handling for numerous data sources in a 
  javascript application.
- We deal with this problem everyday...blah blah.
